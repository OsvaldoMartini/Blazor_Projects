# Blazor Chess


This is blazor chess engine.

Not all rules are implemented yet and it should be refactored.

Now it has only experimental purpose.

This chess engine I had in typescript, was not implemented all chess rules and was not tested well.
Now I rewrote fast and goal was it to do something.
So it is working now somehow and I don't recommend to look inside code before good refactoring :) :D
